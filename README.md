  - Runs isolated Wi-Fi hotspot (`SentinelCore_Fortress`) via `hostapd` and `dnsmasq`.
  - Persistent internet connection via Ethernet or Wi-Fi (e.g., `wlan1` with second adapter, or `wlan0` to router) for Cloudflare Tunnel and optional external APIs (e.g., NVD CVE sync, Google Safe Browsing).

### 2. ESP32 Fleet

- **Node #1 (Wi-Fi Scanner)**: Passively scans Wi-Fi channels, collecting AP/client metadata (SSID, MAC, signal strength).
- **Node #2 (Deauth Actuator)**: Sends 802.11 deauth packets to isolate rogue devices/APs.
- **Node #3 (BLE + Wi-Fi Scanner)**: Scans BLE devices and supplements Wi-Fi coverage.
- **Firmware**: Arduino/PlatformIO with MQTT client, OTA downloader, and fail-safe watchdogs.

### 3. MQTT Communication

- **Broker**: Mosquitto MQTT on Pi (port 1883).
- **Topics**:
  - `esp32/{device_id}/scan`: Wi-Fi/BLE scan results.
  - `esp32/{device_id}/commands`: Deauth, reboot, or OTA commands.
  - `pi/alerts`: Threat notifications.
  - `pi/ota/firmware`: Firmware update payloads.
- **Benefits**: Lightweight, real-time, and decouples nodes for scalability.

### 4. Web UI (React )

- **Features**: Interactive network map (D3.js), threat logs, device details, modular toggles, vulnerability reports, and firewall rule builder.
- **Hosting**: Locally on Pi via Nginx/Caddy (port 8080), compiled as a static React/Bolt build.
- **Global Access**: Exposed via Cloudflare Tunnel (e.g., `https://dashboard.yourdomain.com`).
- **API Integration**: UI calls FastAPI backend via Cloudflare Tunnel URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com`) or relative paths.
- **UX**: Real-time updates via Socket.IO/Axios, sci-fi aesthetic with animated gauges (e.g., ‚ÄúNetwork Fortress Score‚Äù).

### 5. Data Pipeline

- ESP32 nodes publish scan data to MQTT.
- FastAPI backend validates and stores data in SQLite.
- AI module analyzes streams for anomalies, updating threat scores.
- Alerts trigger voice notifications (pyttsx3) or bot messages (Telegram/Discord).
- Dashboard visualizes live data, historical logs, and attack maps.

## üåê Network Topology

### 1. Wi-Fi Hotspot Mode

- **SSID**: `SentinelCore_Fortress`.
- **Components**: `hostapd` for AP, `dnsmasq` for DHCP (assigns IPs to ESP32s and user devices).
- **Benefits**: Isolated, secure environment; zero configuration for users.

### 2. Internet Connectivity

- Pi connects to Internet/Router via **Ethernet** (preferred) or **Wi-Fi** (`wlan1` with second adapter, or `wlan0` if connected to router) to maintain Cloudflare Tunnel and access external APIs.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Exposes local UI (port 8080) and API (port 5000) to the internet via a custom domain or free subdomain (e.g., `dashboard.yourdomain.com`, `api.yourdomain.com`).
- No router port forwarding required; tunnel ensures secure access.

### 3. ESP32 Auto-Provisioning

- Firmware pre-programmed to seek `SentinelCore_Fortress` SSID and auto-connect to MQTT.
- No captive portals, QR codes, or CLI required.
