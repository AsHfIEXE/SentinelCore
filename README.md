## 🌟 Project Vision

**SentinelCore** is a self-contained, distributed, and AI-enhanced cybersecurity platform that transforms a Raspberry Pi and a few ESP32 boards into a professional-grade network monitoring and defense suite.

Built **entirely by a solo developer**, this system is engineered for:

- High privacy (no cloud dependency)
- Ease of deployment (zero config onboarding)
- Real-time defense (autonomous anomaly detection + mitigation)
- Affordable scalability (DIY-friendly components)

### 🚀 Use Cases:

- Secure home/SMB networks from IoT attacks
- Safeguard activist/journalist comms in hostile environments
- Educational tool for teaching network security and distributed systems
- Research platform for anomaly detection, mesh networks, and edge computing

---

## ✨ SentinelCore Breakthroughs

- **Distributed AI-Powered Detection:** ESP32 scanner nodes feed real-time data into local lightweight anomaly detection models (ONNX/Sklearn) running on the Pi.
- **True Plug-and-Play Mesh:** ESP32 nodes auto-connect to the Pi’s hotspot with no manual setup.
- **Rogue Device Isolation:** One-click deauthentication via ESP32 command or iptables blocking.
- **Honeypot DNS Traps:** Identifies malware traffic through fake DNS endpoints.
- **Voice & Visual Alerts:** Local TTS alerts + live dashboard notifications.
- **Full Local Processing:** No cloud, no leaks. All AI, database, and MQTT comms stay on the Pi.
- **OTA Update Mechanism:** Push firmware updates to ESP32s from Pi dashboard.
- **Modular Services:** Toggle any feature (e.g., parental control, AI, honeypot) in UI.

## 🚀 System Architecture Overview

### 1. Raspberry Pi 4B - Central Command Node

- **Services**: MQTT Broker, FastAPI backend, AI engine, OTA server, dashboard
- **Containers**: Dockerized for modular deployment
- **Storage**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL optional)
- **Network**: Runs isolated Wi-Fi network via `hostapd` + `dnsmasq`

### 2. ESP32 Fleet

- **Node #1**: Passive Wi-Fi scanner (channels, clients, APs)
- **Node #2**: Wi-Fi Deauth actuator
- **Node #3**: BLE + Wi-Fi scanner for overlap and coverage

### 3. MQTT Communication

- Topics like `esp32/device_id/scan`, `esp32/device_id/commands`, `pi/alerts`
- Lightweight, real-time pub/sub between sensors and backend

### 4. Web UI (React + Bolt)

- Interactive live graph of network map
- Toggle features, see alerts, view scan history
- Local-only served by Nginx or Caddy

---

## 🌐 Network Topology

### 1. Wi-Fi Hotspot Mode

- `hostapd` creates SSID: **SentinelCore\_Fortress**
- `dnsmasq` assigns DHCP to ESP32s and user devices
- Ensures total isolation from home router if needed

### 2. Optional LAN Mode

- If internet via Ethernet is needed, Pi bridges its internal interface
- User devices can connect via Pi’s hotspot or LAN

### 3. ESP32 Auto Provisioning

- Firmware is pre-programmed to seek Pi’s SSID and auto-MQTT-connect
- No need for captive portals, QR code provisioning, or CLI
